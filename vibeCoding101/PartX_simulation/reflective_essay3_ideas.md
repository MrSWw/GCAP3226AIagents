Title: Effective Communication Strategies (based on the project)

- Clear goals and scope: Align monitoring objectives (two stops, ETA fields) and expected outputs early to avoid rework.
- Shared language and artifacts: Use README, CSV headers and analysis JSON as a common vocabulary to reduce misunderstandings across technical and non-technical team members.
- Real-time feedback and visualization: Charts and snapshot examples help stakeholders see data quality issues (e.g., null-ETA, outliers) quickly.
- Transparent error handling and fixes: Record incidents (serialization, timezone issues), document hotfixes and version changes so fixes are reproducible.
- Low-cost experiments and iterative improvement: Start with simple polling and retry logic, then add outlier detection and archival once stable.
- Stakeholder-focused reporting: Convert technical metrics into decision-ready summaries (mean wait, top outliers, data completeness).
