Process:
- Read all README and project files in the `Team6_BusStopMerge` folder.
- Identify project goals, data sources, methods (GIS, OD data, optimization), and deliverables.

- Summarise key policy issues and suggest follow-up data or analyses needed.

Notes:
- Aim for a concise analysis (500-800 words) focusing on policy implications and recommended next steps for evidence collection and stakeholder consultation.
- If data files (e.g., Bus-Stop-Optimization/) are present, list them in the analysis and propose which should be prioritized for modeling.
