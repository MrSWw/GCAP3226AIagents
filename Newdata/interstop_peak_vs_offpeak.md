# Inter-stop ETA Comparison (Daytime Only)

This compares estimated inter-stop travel time between stop1 and stop2 by subtracting ETA at stop1 from ETA at stop2 at the same snapshot and sequence.

**Analysis windows**: Peak vs daytime off-peak only (excludes nighttime)
**Note**: Negative travel times (data anomalies) have been filtered out
