### Design Best Practices
- **Typography**: Use sans-serif fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans)
- **Color Consistency**: Maintain color scheme across visualizations
- **White Space**: Don't overcrowd - aim for 40-50% empty space for visual breathing room
- **Hierarchy**: Largest text for title, medium for section headings, small for details
- **QR Code**: Add link to full report (use online QR code generator)
- **Contact**: Include team name, course, institution, email, GitHub repo link

## Poster Outline: Suggested Text

### Title
**"Data-Driven Urban Transit Planning: Evidence for Bus Stop Optimization in Hong Kong"**

### Subtitle
**"Demonstrating Systematic Decision-Making Using Open Data & Simulation Modeling"**

### Introduction (2-3 sentences)
Hong Kong's Transport Department has conducted zero bus stop mergers in 10 years despite ongoing urban development. This project demonstrates how publicly available real-time data, combined with simulation modeling, can support evidence-based policy decisions. We analyzed bus congestion at two closely-spaced stops (200m apart) using 96 hours of continuous ETA monitoring and discrete-event simulation.

### Main Findings (2-3 bullet points)
- Route 272A shows **+10.7% congestion increase** during morning peak (112s → 124s median travel time)
- Simulation demonstrates **10.5% mean wait reduction** if stops merge, BUT **8.8% increase in worst-case delays** due to bunching
- Transport Department has access to real-time ETA data but lacks systematic framework for operational efficiency analysis

### Recommendations (2-3 bullet points)
- Implement continuous ETA monitoring and quantitative decision thresholds
- Pilot mergers with comprehensive data collection and cost-benefit analysis
- Establish transparent, evidence-based governance framework for transit optimization

### Conclusion
This research demonstrates that **participatory policy analysis with open data** can improve urban transportation planning while maintaining transparency and stakeholder engagement. Evidence-based decision-making requires both technical rigor and human judgment.
