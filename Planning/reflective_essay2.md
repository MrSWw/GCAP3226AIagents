Working on Team 6’s bus stop merge project deepened my understanding of spatial analysis and the trade-offs between efficiency and accessibility. The biggest challenge was missing data—key ridership and OD patterns were not publicly available, making robust analysis difficult. Drafting an enquiry letter to the government transport department was a complex process: I had to specify our data needs in detail, including bus stop locations, route lists, passenger flow, and accessibility features, while also considering privacy, data formats, and the department’s operational constraints. Communicating our academic purpose and willingness to accept anonymised or aggregated data was essential to increase the chance of a positive response. I used AI tools to help draft and refine the letter, but manual review and adjustment were crucial to ensure clarity and professionalism. This experience taught me that effective communication and data governance are as important as technical skills in policy analysis. It also highlighted the ethical implications of efficiency-driven decisions, especially when working with limited or hard-to-access data. Next, I plan to follow up on our data requests, prioritise GTFS and ridership data, run sensitivity tests, and prepare stakeholder engagement materials that address the needs of elderly and disabled users.
