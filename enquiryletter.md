Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing on behalf of Team 6, a research group at Hong Kong Baptist University conducting a policy analysis on bus stop merging and optimization. Our case study focuses on St. Martin Road and Chong San Road bus stops and their surrounding area. To support evidence-based and participatory policy analysis, we respectfully request access to the following data under the Code on Access to Information:

1. **Bus Stop Data (St. Martin Road, Chong San Road, and nearby area)**
   - Geo-coordinates and attributes of all bus stops in the vicinity, including stop ID, name (Chinese/English), location, and accessibility features (e.g., ramps, tactile paving).

2. **Route and Timetable Data (for all routes serving the above stops)**
   - Route lists, stop sequences, service frequency, timetable, and operator for all bus routes passing through or serving St. Martin Road and Chong San Road.

We understand that some data may be subject to privacy or operational constraints. We are happy to accept aggregated or anonymized datasets, and are open to discussing data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, GTFS, etc.) and any necessary data use agreements.

**Reference to Open Data API**

We note that some of the requested data may be available via the Citybus Open Data API (https://www.citybus.com.hk/datagovhk/bus_eta_api_specifications.pdf) or the data.gov.hk portal. If direct API access is not possible, we kindly request a one-time data export (CSV/JSON/Excel) with the above fields for all stops and routes in the study area.


This request is made under the Code on Access to Information. Our research will be used solely for academic and policy evaluation purposes, and we will ensure proper data governance and attribution. If possible, we would appreciate a response within 2–3 weeks, or advice on the expected timeline and process for data access.

Thank you very much for your attention and support. Please let us know if you require further details about our project or specific data needs.

Best regards,
