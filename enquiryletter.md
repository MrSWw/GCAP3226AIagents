Subject: Data Request for Bus Stop Merge Policy Analysis — Team 6 Research

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing on behalf of Team 6, a research group conducting a policy analysis on bus stop merging and optimization in Hong Kong. Our project aims to evaluate the operational, accessibility, and equity impacts of merging closely located bus stops, with reference to recent case studies and simulation models.

To ensure our analysis is evidence-based and supports transparent, inclusive decision-making, we kindly request access to the following datasets and information:

1. **Bus Stop and Route Data**
	- Geo-coordinates and attributes of all bus stops in the target district/area (including stop ID, name, location, accessibility features).
	- Route lists and stop sequences for all affected bus routes (including service frequency, timetable, and operator).

2. **Passenger Flow and OD Data**
	- Boarding and alighting counts by stop, route, and time period (peak/off-peak, weekday/weekend).
	- Origin-destination (OD) matrices or aggregated trip data, if available, to assess passenger movement patterns.

3. **Pedestrian Accessibility and Infrastructure**
	- Data on pedestrian network connectivity, including sidewalk width, slope, crosswalk locations, and accessibility features (ramps, lifts, tactile paving).
	- Any recent or planned changes to pedestrian infrastructure near the target bus stops.

4. **User Demographics and Vulnerability Indicators**
	- Aggregated data or survey results on passenger age, disability status, and other relevant equity indicators (if available, anonymized).

5. **Operational and Cost Data**
	- Historical and current operating cost data for the affected routes and stops (fuel, maintenance, staffing).
	- Any available cost–benefit analyses or pilot evaluation reports related to bus stop changes.

We understand that some data may be subject to privacy or operational constraints. We are happy to accept aggregated or anonymized datasets, and are open to discussing data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, GTFS, etc.) and any necessary data use agreements.

Our research will be used solely for academic and policy evaluation purposes, and we will ensure proper data governance and attribution. If possible, we would appreciate a response within 2–3 weeks, or advice on the expected timeline and process for data access.

Thank you very much for your attention and support. Please let us know if you require further details about our project or specific data needs.

Best regards,
